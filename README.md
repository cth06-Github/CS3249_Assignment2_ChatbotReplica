# Pre-Consultation Chatbot - Streamlit Replica

This is a Streamlit replica of the Pre-Consultation Chatbot interface for CS3249 Assignment 2. I did NOT design the chatbot. The teaching team designed the actual chatbot. I used AI to replicate the design so that my user participants can try it to get a feel without using the actual chatbot.


## Installation

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Run the Streamlit app with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`
